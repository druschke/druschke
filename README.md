- 👋 Hi, I’m @druschke
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity
- 🌱 I’m currently learning/re-learning my CompTIA A+, then going for my Network+ and Security+
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that is willing to teach me coding as I go through and assist. Please keep in mind that I am a complete n00b at this.
- 📫 How to reach me thru GitHub is the easiest way, I'm planning on being logged in here most of the day just about every day.
